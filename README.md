# Database-Modeling-Facebook
In this project, the goal is to model the Facebook database. This involves designing the model, creating tables with relevant constraints, populating these tables, and ultimately using the resulting database.

## Features

- **Group:** You can create a group with different users.
- **Comments:** You can comment on posts (with comments, likes, photos) of other users on the application.
- **Likes:** As with comments, you can add likes to other users' posts.
- **Followers:** Members can connect with each other by following each other.
- **Messages:** If people follow each other, they can send each other messages to chat.
- **Pages:** It is possible to create multiple pages by users in order to post private or public posts.
- **Posts:** These are images that can be posted on the social network, to display whatever you want.
